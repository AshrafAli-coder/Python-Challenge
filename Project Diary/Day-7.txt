Day-7
Today is day 7 of completing 100days with 100 projects.
The goal of today is to make a hangman game.
The game is simple I have to guess the word without losing all the lives.
The Instructor made 5 steps to achieve today's goal.
In step 1 she teaches how to check whether the letter is correct in our word.
we define the list with words. 
In step 2 she tells how to print the blanks for the choosen word from the list and how to place the correct letter in correct position guessed by user.
In step 3 we make our programme to run until user guesses the correct word and we also make sure that previous guessed correct letter should be there too.
In step 4 we focus about drawing or showing hangman process and lives.
So In step 5 I started to try or achieve this code on my own. At first I got some hurdles but I overcome it with simple thinking process and finally able to achive.
Now I'm enjoying the game I created with my friends too..
