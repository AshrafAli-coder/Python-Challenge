Day-10
Today is day 10 of completing 100 projects in 100days.
So Today's project goal is to build a simple calculator by using functions.
Since we already know functions she decided to go deeper or advanced methods in functions that is just writing a function which output too.
To understand this better she just explain the program of taking first and last name and converting them title case using title function.
After she explains how to use multiple return statements in a function.
She gave me a bonus tip of how to create a docstring for functions, to create it after function declaration in the first identation line we use triple quotes like ''' and end with same triple quotes '''.
Then after that I completed my code and when I check the solution its almost the same and I'm very happy for that...
