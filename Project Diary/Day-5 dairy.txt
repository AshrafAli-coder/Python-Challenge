Day-5
Today is the day of completing 100 python projects.
The goal of today is to make a program which generates password which is combination of symbols, letters and numbers.
"To solve this I thought of using random function to generate number and as for letters and symbols creating a list for each and use random function for accessing those letters and symbols."
To achieve the instructor Angela Yu is teaching about loops.
To understand for loops the instructor shows sum function using for loop and gave me a challenge to write code for max function using for loop and I had made it.
After going with loops , instructor goes on with range function and again she gave me a challenge and it's a piece of cake to me as I learned a bit of python.
The instructor says that the has easy level and hard level. I tried the easy level with my logic and it's just the same as easy level. Now I wonder how to do the hard level.
I had my thought processed very intense , but the solution for the hard level is the one of the processes I had thought when I'm solving easy level. I just laugh at my self after seeing some solution and made it.
I learned the shuffle in random module which is used to shuffle the elements in lists and the syntax is random.shuffle(list_name)
