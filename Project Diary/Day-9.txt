Day-9
Today is day 9 of completing 100 days projects. 
Today's goal is to create a program that conducts secret auction.
For that She started to teach about dictionaries. How to create it and use it and she explains about basic operations of dictionaries first.
Then she teaches about nested dictionaries and reminds of nested list.
Now its time to write the solution for the project. I came up with a simple solution and when I check the solution of her ,her solution a bit complex than mine and she define a function where didn't and for calculating the winner she advices to use max function so I change max instead of using  for loop.
Finally It's done and my silent bidding project is ready
