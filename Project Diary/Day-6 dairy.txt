Day-6
Today is the day 6 of completing 100 days challenge of python.
In today's lecture the instructor Angela Yu taught about functions. To understand more better she told me about a website called "Reborg's World".
Where we have to use defined functions to play or move the robot in the maze or chessboard. It had so much fun in learning the functions like this.
After that the Instructor told about the importance of Identation along with Tab Vs Space to Indent with a movie scene which is in Silicon Valley.
Next she taught about while loop and again used the "Reborg's World" website to understand it better.
Then she told about the differences between for and while loop and when to use it.
Actually she showed us there are four hurdles in Reborg's World and I have completed the three hurdles with ease.
But the fourth one is difficult one it takes sometime to solve that but I achieved it.
Now it's time to write the code for our final project which is to help robot to get out of the maze.
At first I thought it's hard and gone into complex way and for some condition's it's executed but for other it's not.
So I erased the code and again read over the instruction and tried then I have made it. 
But when I execute this code for around 45 times it fails 1 time I don't understand so I see the solution the thing is that instead of if I just had used while statements.
Today I learned a lesson to not to think in complex way and always try to simply the code and read over and over again the instructions.
