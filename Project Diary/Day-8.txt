Day-8
Today is day 8 of completing the 100 days python project challenge.
As of today's goal I have to create a Caesar Cipher which converting a message into encrypted message and decode it.
So it follows simple rule that if the A is counted as 0 then B is 1 etc..
If the shift is 3 then A is written as D.
So regarding that she revised about functions how to create and use it.
She teaches about what is parameter and what is argument in function.
Next she explains about multiple arguments and how it used in functions and she also explains about positional and keyword arguments too.
So as per next part she entrusts me to develop encryption and after I created my own code I saw the solution and my code is a bit harder than her. I used an extra list and I also used if statement where she uses a different logic.
So next she advised to create decrypt function for decryption so I used the logic which is used in encryption by her so in my programme I have two logics.
Next she advised to create a new function ceaser which combines both encrypt and decrypt function.
Next she asks to made some modifications like to run the function until user wants and print logo. And last I successfully completed the code
It is really fun while making these types of codes...
